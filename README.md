# ChatGPT HTTP Web Service

Simple Express server to interface with ChatGPT. Uses [chatgpt-api](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) in the background.

## Set Up

1. Install npm packages: `npm install`
2. Copy `.env.example` to `.env`
3. Enter OpenAI credentials into `.env` (please look through the main `index.js` source file first to understand how the credentials are being used)

## Running

In the background, [chatgpt-api](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) is being used to interact with ChatGPT, which uses `puppeteer` to spawn a browser window. Meaning, a non-headless server that can display a browser window is required to run this.

1. Run with `node index.js`
2. Browser window opens, solve the reCAPTCHA
3. Done. Server is serving on `localhost:3000`. Endpoints:
    * `POST /api/chat`, accepts JSON data containing message to send to ChatGPT: `{"message": "Hello world"}`. Subsequent requests are followed-up by default.
    * `GET /api/reinit` to reauthenticate with OpenAI.
    * `GET /api/reset` to start a new conversation.

## Issues

If `puppeteer` throws an error stating it can't find `chrome.exe` or whichever equivalent binary for your system, you might need to edit `node_modules/chatgpt/build/index.js`, around line 1060. Search for the path and point it accordingly to where your Chrome is located at.
